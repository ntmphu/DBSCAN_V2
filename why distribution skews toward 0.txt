why distribution skews toward 0
-> p<0.05 nhiu
-> reject H0 when H0 true nhiu. H0: j is not a true outlier
-> (claim j is a true outlier when (j is actually not a true outlier)) nhiu
if interval O = O_obs too big compare to  X_j - mean(X_-O)

if j is true outlier -> reject -> p value thap
p value thap nhieu => j is true outlier nhieu
dbscan wrt. eps and minpts successfully detect true outlier
=> it can lack of all true outliers, but all the detected one is true
=> the eps is high
=> decrease eps -> increase outliers detected, including true and not true ones OR find dataset with 







sioc:
-----------|-\-\------|------------------
si:
-----------|-\-\------|----|------|------




why si is not different from si:
just a few change in the dataset will result different set of outlier, so it is rare when neps != neps_obs but still O = O_obs

-> j in O: dbscan minpts and eps from X

When O resulted from dbscan is all true outlier?
